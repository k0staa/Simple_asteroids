# Simple_asteroids
Simple asteroid game. ver 0.1
This project was my first game made using Java. It uses AffineTransform class to move and rotate geometric objects and thats why it is not algorithmically fast.

Music is taken from Freesound.org.
In game music is made by orangefreesound and its called "Music Loop electronic 115 bpm".
Laser shot sound is made by bubaproducer and its called "Laser Shot Silenced".
Exploading of asteroid sound is made by mitchelk and ist called "Explode001".

Running game instructions
Just compile to .jar and run using java -jar . I will add some run scripts later.
